3. When would you want to use state instead of props?

```js
// put your answer here
// You would use state when you have data that needs to be updated or changed based on user interactions or other events.
```

4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?

```js
// put your answer here
// "Immutable" means unchangeable or unable to be modified. In the context of React, immutability is an important concept because it helps to prevent unintended side effects and makes it easier to reason about data changes. Props are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified by the child component that receives them.
```
